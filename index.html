  <p>SDG 2 (Sustainable Development Goal 2), also known as "Zero Hunger", aims to end hunger, achieve food security, improve nutrition, and promote sustainable agriculture by 2030.</p>

  <p>Hunger is a complex issue with numerous interconnected causes. Some of them are:</p>

  <h2>1. Poverty and Inequality</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Poverty prevents people from affording adequate and nutritious food.</li>
    <li>Inequality in resource distribution, like land, water, and credit, limits access to food and production.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>2. Conflict</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Conflict disrupts food production, displaces populations, and hinders access to markets and aid.</li>
    <li>Conflict zones often experience higher rates of hunger and malnutrition.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>3. Climate Change</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Extreme weather events like droughts, floods, and heatwaves damage crops, livestock, and infrastructure, leading to food shortages.</li>
    <li>Climate change impacts livelihoods and forces displacements, increasing vulnerability to hunger.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>4. Economic Factors</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Economic downturns and instability lead to job losses and reduced purchasing power.</li>
    <li>Food price fluctuations, especially in developing countries, disproportionately affect vulnerable populations.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>5. Gender Equality</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Women and girls often face barriers in accessing food, resources, and education, making them more vulnerable to hunger.</li>
    <li>They also have unique nutritional needs, especially during pregnancy and breastfeeding, which may not be met.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>6. Food Waste</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Globally, a significant amount of food is wasted, contributing to food insecurity.</li>
    <li>Inefficient food systems and lack of infrastructure can lead to post-harvest losses.</li>
  </ul>
